Integrating Unit Tests into OrdersApi in Visual Studio
1. Open Your Solution

Open Visual Studio.

Go to File → Open → Project/Solution.

Select your OrdersApi.sln solution file and open it.

2. Add the Existing Test Project

In Solution Explorer, right-click the Solution (top-level item).

Select Add → Existing Project…

Navigate to the Orders.Tests project folder.

Select the Orders.Tests.csproj file and click Open.

The test project will now appear under your solution in Solution Explorer.

3. Add Project Reference to API

In Solution Explorer, expand the Orders.Tests project.

Right-click Dependencies → Add Project Reference…

Check the box for the OrdersApi project.

Click OK.

This allows the tests to access controllers, models, and DbContext from the API project.

4. Build the Solution

Go to Build → Build Solution (or press Ctrl+Shift+B).

Ensure both projects compile successfully.

5. Run Unit Tests

Open Test Explorer:

Test → Test Explorer

Click Run All or select individual tests to run.

Test results will appear in the Test Explorer window.

Visual Studio automatically discovers xUnit (or other supported frameworks) tests.

6. Optional: Organize Projects

You can create solution folders for organization:

Right-click the solution → Add → New Solution Folder → name it Tests.

Drag Orders.Tests into that folder for clarity.

7. Notes

Tests now run as part of the same solution, so you can:

Debug tests directly in Visual Studio.

Run tests before or after API changes.

Ensure tests always use the latest API code.

No need to copy files—the existing Orders.Tests project remains intact.
